                Coronaviruses are a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds.
                In humans and birds, they cause respiratory tract infections that can range from mild to lethal.
                Mild illnesses in humans include some cases of the common cold
                (which is also caused by other viruses, predominantly rhinoviruses), while more lethal varieties can cause SARS, MERS, and COVID-19.
                In cows and pigs they cause diarrhea, while in mice they cause hepatitis and encephalomyelitis.
            </p>
            <p>
                Coronaviruses constitute the subfamily Orthocoronavirinae, in the family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales, and realm Riboviria.
                 They are enveloped viruses with a positive-sense single-stranded RNA genome and a nucleocapsid of helical symmetry.
                 The genome size of coronaviruses ranges from approximately 26 to 32 kilobases, one of the largest among RNA viruses.
                 They have characteristic club-shaped spikes that project from their surface, 
                 which in electron micrographs create an image reminiscent of the solar corona, from which their name derives.

         <h2>How India’s second wave became the worst COVID-19 surge in the world</h2>

        During the past few weeks, Indian social media has been inundated with SOS messages: 
        hospitals tweeting about dwindling oxygen supplies and physicians watching helplessly as patients perish from preventable deaths.
         A journalist pleading for but denied a hospital bed took to Twitter to log his deteriorating condition till he died.
          Overwhelmed crematoria are working round-the-clock to keep up with the pace of bodies; 
          furnaces have melted down from overuse and additional funeral platforms are being built outside. 
          Such are the heartbreaking messages and haunting images that highlight the formidable second wave of the coronavirus pandemic raging through the country.

        India broke the world record for the most new coronavirus cases this week, surpassing 330,000 new cases on Friday, 
        as deaths in the past 24 hours jumped to a record 2,263, the health ministry said.
        <br>
         The United States held the previous one-day record with 300,669 new cases recorded on January 8, 2021.
         During the second wave in India, many cases of mucormycosis, also known as the black fungus, have been reported in patients with diabetes and patients with COVID-19, 
         as well as patients who were recovering from infection. The excessive use of steroids in the treatment of COVID-19 and immunosuppression by the virus led to the emergence of this opportunistic fungal infection.
         Although cases of black fungus were reported during the first wave, cases during the second wave have become more prominent in many cities of India, leading state governments to declare this too as an epidemic.
          As of June 7, 2021, the Indian Ministry of Health had recorded 28 252 cases of black fungus.
          The risk of the white fungus Aspergillosis—assumed to be even more fatal than the black fungus—is also on the rise with some cases reported in parts of India

    Covid pandemic has made the healthcare system difficult to prepare for the situation. 
    Ever since the second wave of the pandemic started, the healthcare system in India has been teetering on the brink,
     with many hospitals unable to handle the relentless inflow of patients whilst also running short of beds, oxygen cylinders and other essential
     As the second wave crashed into 12 states across the country, medical health experts began tracking an aggressive new strain of virus that hit the lungs, almost immediately,
      on the first day of the infection. Shortness of breath was the defining medical symptom of the second wave.


     The EMS department at our hospital, which has a capacity of 5 beds, has been handling over 20 patients,
     at any given point of time, in the second wave. We are forced to turn away many patients. 
     The first wave of the pandemic

     It is definitely worse than last year. It's not a second wave but it feels like Covid tsunami had begun to loom over the horizon. 
     It feels as people were dropping their guards assuming that the worst was behind them, India was hit by a second wave of the pandemic, 
     the magnitude of which is rendering its already precarious healthcare system more overburdened than ever. 
     India has been reporting over two lakh cases a day in month of April and May, 
     making it one of the worst Covid-affected countries in the world. 

     Arrowing accounts of overburdened hospitals, people scrambling to secure oxygen supplies and medicines such as Remdesevir and  Actemra, morgues piling up with bodies, 
     and funeral pyres flickering away late into the night amid soaring deaths.


     The new strain of the virus amid the second wave is more virulent and infectious, which leaves younger and healthy people in critical conditions as compared to before, 
     they are gasping for breathe. And the lung involvement is like really, really high. We are seeing people in the 25-30 age groups dying.

     There was shortage of enough doctors or healthcare workers, especially given the spike in coronavirus cases,
      adding that this is also having repercussions on those patients with other critical illnesses as they face inordinate delays in getting treated.

     The shortage of supplies is also definitely a drawback. In the First wave last year we were shortage of PPE and in the second wave working in the hospital, seeing more deaths, seeing the shortage of supplies and the hunt for medications by hospital and patient relatives - all this is definitely something that's creating a horrifying situation for all of us.

     All healthcare workers want to work, we have no problem in giving our services to deal with this virus and fight against the pandemic. But if we don't get the resources to work with, what will the healthcare workers do?

     I wish all doctors HAPPY DOCTORS DAY and we have to work like team and be stronger to fight against this Pandemic with whatever resource we have.

    >>> At least 748 doctors died due to COVID-19 last year

   </div>
    <div style="font-size: 24px;margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 25px;">
        The IMA report states that 51 doctors have succumbed to Covid from Tamil Nadu so far in the second wave, the highest being in Delhi — 128.
        the number of doctors who died during the second wave of the Covid has risen to 798.   


        The country was hit hardest by the second wave of Covid. Since the first wave, doctors have been rescuing corona patients. Doctors have been fighting against corona regardless of their lives.


        As many as 798 doctors across the country have died since the second wave hit the country, according to the Indian Medical Association.
         The highest death toll was 128 in Delhi, 115 in Bihar, 79 in Uttar Pradesh, and 62 in West Bengal. It also states that 51 doctors have died in Tamil Nadu so far. It is noteworthy that a total of 736 doctors died during the first wave of the corona.

        Covid second wave was the toughest time in a doctor’s life</div>

        <div style="font-size: 24px;margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 25px;">
            Facing long exhaustive working hours during the second wave of pandemic and wearing PPE kits, doctors have got very little breathing space, literally. There have been no vacations and no off-days. Now they prepare for the next wave amid heightened anxiety of catching the virus themselves.


As experts suggest the next wave may strike sooner with states ending lockdowns and people throwing Covid norms to the wind, doctors have tougher times ahead.

'With each positive patient, we are putting our lives in danger'

"When we became doctors, or chose this profession, we vowed to take care of people. What we did not sign up for was working 24-hour shifts in PPEs as we suffocate, sweat and dehydrate profusely inside that wear-in jail. This pandemic has left the healthcare workers most vulnerable. We have seen our own contract the virus and succumb. We have been left with fatigue, anger, frustration and helplessness," says Dr Uttam Thakur, president of the Association of Resident Doctors (ARD) at PGIMER.

Terming the behaviour of people reckless which further agitates the Covid warriors, he says, "People are flocking markets and hill stations as if there is no tomorrow. Masking up is the basic precaution required, but no they will not do that. What they fail to realise is with each positive patient, we doctors are putting our lives in danger treating them. This now seems like a never-ending process -- battle waves, prepare for the next, then battle wave again. If people mask up, we will be motivated to save them, help them."

Recklessness may drive up third wave<br>

<div style="font-size: 24px;margin-left: 25px;margin-right: 25px;">
    This recklessness may very well be the reason to act as a catalyst for the initiation of third wave. "Third wave may strike sooner than we expect if people behave as carelessly as they did after the first wave. Masks and social distancing are still important as they always were during the pandemic. Most of the people are still not fully vaccinated, so we will have to be careful," said former Panchkula CMO, Dr Jasjeet Kaur.

Talking about mental fatigue and how Panchkula is dealing with it, she added, "Yes, medicos are now tired but we are a bit liberal with casual leave and flexible times to help them take well-deserved vacation and get household work in order. At the same time, preparedness for next wave has started. Trainings are being organised for refreshing their knowledge and skills, especially in ICU/ HDU duties. Hope for a less severe third wave but we are ready to deal with it if and when it reaches us."

'When not working, we're taking calls, answering queries'<br>

The pandemic coupled with the epidemic of mucormycosis has further stressed the doctors. Dr Vinci, ENT junior resident at GMCH-32, says, "Working in this pandemic with mucormycosis on a rise coupled with long working hours and no offs in past few weeks has taken a toll. It's not like we didn’t work hectic days earlier but it’s become tiring now. There are days when my family remains concerned, with work not giving me the right mindspace and time to talk to them properly on several occasions."

The work done by doctors does not remain subjected to their official working hours but stretches into their personal lives and well-being. "Even when not officially working, we are taking calls, coordinating and answering queries. So yes, round-the-clock we are contributing towards handling this pandemic. Initially we were energetic and on our toes but with days and weeks crossing by without any breaks working in general ward under heat, it has become difficult. People with mucor come in a debilitating state. Survival becomes a question for them. It is hard for them and for us as well," Vinci adds.

New variants worrisome, masks only respite<br>

Re-stressing the need to opt for protective measures, especially in view of new emerging variants of the virus, Dr Sachin Verma, working in internal medicine at a private hospital in Mohali, says, "As new variants come up with reports that even those fully vaccinated may not be completely protected and reports of the Delta plus variant which may spread even with the slightest of contact are worrisome. As waves progress and new variants emerge, the time of exposure required to be infected is quickly decreasing with severity of the disease increasing. Masks and precautions are extremely necessary."

Insisting vaccination is not a 100 per cent guarantee for prevention, he points out, "Vaccination will only prevent severity, not infection. Several despite taking both doses, especially in medical fraternity, have succumbed. Vaccines are all new, nobody has seen their exact efficacy. We need to be very careful."
